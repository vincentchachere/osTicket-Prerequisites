<h2>üìù Installation Steps - Part A: Create a 'Resource Group'</h2>

<h3>1. ) Starting at the 'Home' screen in your Microsoft Azure Portal</h3>

 >**Click: the 'Resource Groups' icon that's already on your home screen**

 >**OR..**

 >**Search: 'Resource Groups' and click that one. It will take you to the same place, which is the Resource Groups Default Directory.**

 >**NOTE: You can make a 'Resource Group' at the same time you create a VM. I just wanted to show you how to do it step-by-step.**
 
<h2></h2>

<h3>2. ) After that, select 'Create' to start your resource group</h3>

 >**Or..**

 >**You can click the blue 'Create' in the middle of the screen as well, and it will take you to the same place.**

<h2></h2>

<h3>3. ) Next, we'll input the following:</h3>

 >**Resource Group Name: RG-osTicket**

 >**Region: (US) West US 3**

 >***Scroll Down**

<h2></h2>

<h3>4. ) Now, let's click 'Review + Create'</h3>

 >**Dont worry about the 'Tags' section, we don't need that part for this lab.**

 >**The 'Tags' section is used for organizational purposes.**

 >**NOTE: We have NOT finished creating the resource group yet by clicking 'Review + Create'. Microsoft Azure let's you double check (review) the information you input before finalizing (creating) your resource group. It also does this for virtual machines, so make it a habit to double check the information you type in, so that you don't have to erase everything you end up creating, because of one wrong letter.**

<h2></h2>

<h3>6. ) Finally, we review and create!</h3>

 >**Look over the resource group information**

 >**Verify its all correct**

 >**Click 'Create' to bring alive our first resource group!**

<h2>üìù Installation Steps - Part B: Create a 'Resource Group'</h2>

<h2></h2>

<h3> 7. ) Now we Refresh and Go inside our newly created Resource Group</h3>

 >**First, click Refresh then if your resource group doesnt pop up..**
 >**Click 'Refresh' and it should show up.**

 >**NOTE: If your resource group doesnt show up just go through the steps again, and if it doesn't let you create a resource group with 'RG-osTicket' (the name you originally typed in), then that's how you know it went through and you just have to wait a minute, refresh your 'Resource Groups Default Directory', and let technology do its thing.**

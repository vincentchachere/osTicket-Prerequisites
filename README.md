<h2>üìù Installation Steps - Part A: Create a 'Resource Group'</h2><br>

<h3>1. ) Starting at the 'Home' screen in your Microsoft Azure Portal</h3>

 >**Click: the 'Resource Groups' icon that's already on your home screen or..**

 >**You can Search: 'Resource Groups' and click that one. It will take you to the same place, which is the 'Resource Groups Default Directory'.**

 >**NOTE: You can make a 'Resource Group' at the same time you create a VM. I just wanted to show you how to do it step-by-step.**
 
<h2></h2><br>

<h3>2. ) After that, select 'Create' to start your resource group</h3>

 >**Or..**

 >**You can click the blue 'Create' in the middle of the screen as well, and it will take you to the same place.**

<h2></h2><br>

<h3>3. ) Next, we'll input the following:</h3>

 >**ATTENTION: Double check spelling when creating anything (resource groups, virtual machines, etc.) or you will have to delete it all and start over, because once it's created the information you initially inserted will NOT be able to be edited (name, region, etc.)**

 >**Resource Group Name: RG-osTicket**

 >**Region: (US) West US 3**

 >***Scroll Down**

<h2></h2><br>

<h3>4. ) Now, let's click 'Review + Create'</h3>

 >**Dont worry about the 'Tags' section, we don't need that part for this lab.**

 >**The 'Tags' section is used for organizational purposes.**

 >**NOTE: We have NOT finished creating the resource group yet by clicking 'Review + Create'. Microsoft Azure let's you double check (review) the information you input before finalizing (creating) your resource group. It also does this for virtual machines, so make it a habit to double check the information you type in, so that you don't have to erase everything you end up creating, because of one wrong letter.**

<h2></h2><br>

<h3>6. ) Finally, we review and create!</h3>

 >**Look over the resource group information.**

 >**Verify its all correct.**

 >**Click 'Create' to bring alive our first resource group!**

## Congrats!
### You created you're Resource Group!

 >**You should see the 'Successfully Ceated Resource Group Notification' in the top right corner of your screen.**

 >**NOTE: If you ever a resource group or virtual machine and DO NOT see it in your Azure Portal in its correct location, there's two solutions to this. First, refresh your Resource Group Default Directory Azure Portal, or if thats unsuccessful, just go through the steps again and if it doesn't let you create a resource group with the name 'RG-osTicket' (the name you originally typed in for the resurce group), then that's how you know the Resource Group is created, you just have to wait a little longer and refresh your Resource Group Default Directory in your Azure Portal.**

 >**NOTE: If your resource group doesnt show up just go through the steps again, and if it doesn't let you create a resource group with 'RG-osTicket' (the name you originally typed in), then that's how you know it went through and you just have to wait a minute, refresh your 'Resource Groups Default Directory', and let technology do its thing.**
